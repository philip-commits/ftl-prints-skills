# Daily Activity Summary

Read-only activity log for Philip Munroe showing everything that happened today in GoHighLevel — messages sent/received, notes created, tasks created, and stage movements.

---

## How to Run

**Step 1: Fetch today's activity data.**

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ghl-activity/assets/fetch_activity.py
```

This script:
- Fetches all pipeline opportunities via GHL REST API
- For each contact (max 3 concurrent): fetches messages, notes, and tasks
- Filters everything to today (Eastern time — Fort Lauderdale local)
- Classifies messages by channel, direction, and source (manual/automated/api)
- Captures stage change activity messages
- Writes structured JSON to `/tmp/ftl_activity.json`

**On 401 error:** The script prints auth re-setup instructions and exits. Relay to Philip.

**Step 2: Read the output.**

```
Read: /tmp/ftl_activity.json
```

**Step 3: Present the summary using this format:**

## Notes

- "Today" is calculated in Eastern time (America/New_York) to match Philip's local day
- Message source classification:
  - **Manual** = sent by a human via the GHL app (source=app or userId present)
  - **Automated** = sent by a workflow (source=workflow)
  - **API** = sent via API integration (source=api) — counted under automated
- The script reuses OAuth2 auth from the `/ghl` skill (`ghl_auth.py`)
- Per-contact detail is available in `/tmp/ftl_activity.json` if needed
